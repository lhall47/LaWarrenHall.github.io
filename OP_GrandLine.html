    <h1>The Grand Line</h1>
    <p>
        The <strong>Grand Line</strong> is every pirate's dream and nightmare combined into one vast ocean. 
        There are two parts to the <strong>Grand Line</strong>, Paradise and the New World. The stakes are 
        always high, exciting adventures are around every corner and every pirate that is seeking fame, fortune,
        power and the legendary treasue known as the <strong>One Piece</strong> must do their best at conquering
        the <strong>Grand Line</strong>.
    </p>
        
    <p> 
        The <strong>Grand Line</strong>  is comprised of a ton of island that each have their own unique cultures,
        dangers, mysteries and civilations. The beginning of the <strong>Grand Line</strong>  is called "Paradise" but 
        the journey is not easy, even during the frist stretch of the <strong>Grand Line</strong> pirate crews strength,
        intelligence and loyalty are tested at any point in time the moment that they begin their journies. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The "New World" is the second half of the <strong>Grand Line</strong> where only the toughest of pirates should be sailing.
        The sea itself is unpredicatable, weather patterns are extremely chaotic, the creatures are ferocious on another level.
        Only the elite, battle experienced and toughest of pirates will be able to survive in these waters. Just like in "Paradis"
        the island are all drastically different and inhabited by formidable species that often provide greater mysteries, treasures
        and experiences to the pirates that are traveling these waters. The "New World" is the true place that strength, loyalty, 
        intelligence and will-power are tested amongst the pirates on these waters.
